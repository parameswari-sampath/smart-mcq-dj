  session_focus: Fix CSV import and manual question creation duplicate detection issues
  
  user_requests:
    - Fix CSV import duplicate detection issue between different teachers
    - Remove organization feature that was causing duplicate conflicts
    - Add missing duplicate detection to manual question creation
    - Ensure consistent behavior between CSV import and manual creation
    - Fix template errors and improve user experience
  
  issues_identified:
    csv_import_duplicate_problem:
      - Teacher 1 creates 10 questions, Teacher 2 imports same questions
      - CSV import shows "duplicates found" even though different teachers
      - Root cause: Both teachers assigned to same "Default Organization" 
      - Duplicate detection was organization-wide instead of teacher-specific
    
    manual_creation_missing_duplicates:
      - Manual question creation had no duplicate detection at all
      - Only CSV import was checking for duplicates
      - Inconsistent behavior between two creation methods
      - Template errors when handling None question objects
  
  implementation_completed:
    organization_removal:
      - Removed organization field from Question, Test, Profile models
      - Deleted Organization model entirely from accounts app
      - Updated all views, admin interfaces, and forms
      - Created database migrations to safely remove organization fields
      - Updated registration process to remove organization assignment
      
    csv_import_fix:
      - Changed duplicate detection from organization-scoped to teacher-scoped
      - Updated logic: Question.objects.filter(title=X, created_by=teacher)
      - Now each teacher can import same questions independently
      - Maintains security: teachers only see their own questions
      
    manual_creation_fix:
      - Added duplicate detection to question_create() function
      - Added duplicate detection to question_edit() function (excluding current)
      - Implemented proper error handling with user-friendly messages
      - Enhanced form data preservation on validation errors
      
    template_fixes:
      - Fixed VariableDoesNotExist error for None question objects
      - Updated question_form.html with safe null checking
      - Improved form data preservation with conditional templates
      - Enhanced user experience with Bootstrap validation styling
  
  files_modified:
    models:
      - accounts/models.py (removed Organization, updated Profile)
      - questions/models.py (removed organization field)
      - tests/models.py (removed organization field)
    
    views:
      - bulk_operations/views.py (updated CSV duplicate detection)
      - questions/views.py (added manual duplicate detection)
      - accounts/views.py (removed organization assignment)
      - tests/views.py (removed organization references)
    
    admin:
      - accounts/admin.py (removed Organization admin)
      - questions/admin.py (removed organization references)
      - tests/admin.py (removed organization references)
    
    templates:
      - templates/questions/question_form.html (fixed None object handling)
    
    migrations:
      - accounts/migrations/0002_remove_profile_organization_delete_organization.py
      - questions/migrations/0002_remove_question_organization.py
      - tests/migrations/0004_remove_test_organization.py
  
  testing_verification:
    organization_removal:
      - Database migrations applied successfully
      - All organization references removed from codebase
      - No import errors or template exceptions
      - Models load correctly without organization fields
    
    duplicate_detection_consistency:
      - CSV import: Teacher-specific duplicate detection working
      - Manual creation: Teacher-specific duplicate detection working  
      - Both methods use identical logic for consistency
      - Error messages clear and user-friendly
    
    user_experience:
      - Form data preserved on validation errors
      - Template handles both create and edit modes
      - Bootstrap validation styling applied correctly
      - No template errors on question creation page
  
  technical_achievements:
    database_schema:
      - Safely removed organization fields without data loss
      - Maintained referential integrity during migration
      - Simplified data model removes unnecessary complexity
      - Teacher-specific filtering more efficient than organization-based
    
    code_consistency:
      - Both creation methods use identical duplicate detection
      - Consistent error handling across all question operations
      - Uniform security model: teachers access only their own data
      - Clean separation of concerns without organization overhead
    
    user_workflow:
      - Multiple teachers can create identical question sets
      - No false duplicate errors in CSV import
      - Clear feedback when actual duplicates detected
      - Seamless experience between manual and bulk operations
  
  problem_resolution:
    original_issue: "CSV import duplicate detection checking entire database instead of teacher-specific"
    solution_approach: "Remove organization feature and implement teacher-specific duplicate detection"
    final_result: "Each teacher maintains independent question bank with consistent duplicate detection"
    
    consistency_achieved:
      - Manual creation: Question.objects.filter(title=X, created_by=teacher, is_active=True)
      - CSV import: Question.objects.filter(title=X, created_by=teacher, is_active=True)
      - Edit operation: Same filter with .exclude(pk=current_question.pk)
