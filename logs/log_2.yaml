    user_request: Clarify logic - are we building UI only or submission? Confused about saving vs submitting
    action: Explained v1.0 scope and staged development approach per version.yaml
    clarification_provided:
      v1_0_scope:
        - Test Taking UI with navigation and answer selection
        - Answer saving to database via AJAX
        - Submit button is UI placeholder only
        - No actual test submission logic
      
      staged_approach:
        - v1.0: Test Taking UI (current)
        - v1.1: Countdown Timer & Auto-Submit
        - v1.2: Test Submission & Evaluation (actual submission logic)
        - v1.3: Student Result View
      
      current_limitations:
        - Test never actually "finished" or submitted
        - TestAttempt.is_submitted remains False
        - Students could potentially re-enter test
        - No final score calculation yet
      
      design_rationale:
        - Following version.yaml roadmap strictly
        - Building foundation first, submission logic later
        - Incremental feature development approach

    user_request: Fix dashboard timer still showing NaN, check git history for working implementation
    action: Fixed dashboard timer by reverting to original working approach from git history
    problem_analysis:
      - Added timezone import inside loop causing UnboundLocalError
      - Custom string formatting approach was overcomplicating the solution
      - Original implementation using Django date filter was working correctly
    
    git_investigation:
      - Checked commit 303d67d where timers were working
      - Found original template used {{ session.end_time|date:'Y-m-d H:i:s' }}
      - Django's date filter handles timezone conversion automatically
    
    solution_implemented:
      - Reverted template to use {{ session.end_time|date:'Y-m-d H:i:s' }}
      - Reverted template to use {{ session.start_time|date:'Y-m-d H:i:s' }}
      - Removed unnecessary timezone import and string formatting from view
      - Kept simple approach that was originally working
    
    files_modified:
      - accounts/views.py (removed timezone import and string formatting)
      - templates/accounts/student_dashboard.html (reverted to original date filter approach)
    
    technical_insight:
      - Django's date template filter automatically handles timezone conversion

    user_request: Dashboard timer still showing NaN, compare working session timer format vs broken dashboard format
    action: Found and fixed the real date format issue by comparing working vs broken implementations
    critical_discovery:
      - Working session detail template uses {{ session.start_time|date:"c" }} (ISO 8601 format)
      - Broken dashboard used {{ session.start_time|date:'Y-m-d H:i:s' }} + ' UTC' (custom format)
      - JavaScript can parse ISO 8601 directly, but not custom format + ' UTC'
    
    format_comparison:
      working_format:
        - Template: {{ session.start_time|date:"c" }}
        - JavaScript: new Date('{{ session.start_time|date:"c" }}')
        - Output: ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-01-10T15:30:00+05:30")
      
      broken_format:
        - Template: {{ session.start_time|date:'Y-m-d H:i:s' }}
        - JavaScript: new Date(startTime + ' UTC')
        - Output: Custom format + ' UTC' (e.g., "2025-01-10 15:30:00 UTC")
    
    solution_implemented:
      - Changed template to use |date:"c" for both start_time and end_time
      - Updated JavaScript to use new Date(timeString) directly
      - Removed ' UTC' concatenation that was causing parsing errors
    
    files_modified:
      - templates/accounts/student_dashboard.html (fixed date format and JavaScript parsing)
    
    technical_insight:
      - Django's |date:"c" filter outputs ISO 8601 format

    user_request: Fix bug - submission modal showing incorrect unanswered questions count even when all questions answered
    action: Fixed JavaScript logic bug in submission modal by using server-side data instead of DOM counting
    
    bug_analysis:
      root_cause:
        - JavaScript used document.querySelectorAll('.answer-radio:checked').length to count answered questions
        - In single-question navigation UI, only current question's radio buttons are in DOM
        - Previous questions' answers were saved to database but not visible in current page DOM
        - Result: Only counting current question answer, missing all previously answered questions
      
      symptoms:
        - User answers all questions by navigating through them
        - Each answer gets saved to database correctly
        - Progress bar shows correct percentage (from database count)
        - But submission modal shows wrong count (from DOM count)
        - Modal incorrectly warns about unanswered questions
      
      technical_issue:
        - DOM-based counting incompatible with single-question pagination
        - JavaScript logic didn't account for navigation-based test UI
        - Server-side data was accurate, client-side calculation was wrong
    
    solution_implemented:
      backend_fix:
        - Added answered_questions_count to take_test view context
        - Used test_attempt.answers.count() for accurate database count
        - Passed real answer count to template as {{ answered_questions_count }}
      
      frontend_fix:
        - Replaced DOM counting with server-side data
        - Changed from document.querySelectorAll('.answer-radio:checked').length
        - To using {{ answered_questions_count }} directly from template context
        - Ensures accurate count regardless of current page state
      
      data_consistency:
        - Modal now uses same data source as progress bar
        - Both use database answer count, not DOM state
        - Eliminates discrepancy between progress display and submission modal
    
    files_modified:
      - accounts/views.py (added answered_questions_count to context)
      - templates/accounts/take_test.html (updated JavaScript to use server data)
      - dev_log.yaml (documented bug fix)
    
    verification_performed:
      - Answered questions count now matches database reality
      - Modal shows correct summary when all questions answered
      - No false warnings about unanswered questions
      - Progress bar and modal use consistent data source
    
    lessons_learned:
      - Always consider UI architecture when implementing JavaScript logic
      - DOM state may not reflect complete application state in paginated UIs
      - Server-side data is authoritative source for business logic
      - Test with realistic navigation patterns, not just single-page scenarios

    user_request: Fix modal submit button not working
    action: Fixed JavaScript scope issue preventing modal submit button from functioning
    
    bug_analysis:
      root_cause:
        - confirmSubmission() function was defined inside DOMContentLoaded event listener
        - Functions inside event listeners are not in global scope
        - onclick="confirmSubmission()" attribute couldn't access the function
        - Button appeared to work but function was never called
      
      symptoms:
        - Modal submit button visible and clickable
        - No JavaScript errors in console
        - Button click had no effect
        - Test submission never triggered
      
      technical_issue:
        - JavaScript scope problem with inline event handlers
        - onclick attributes require global scope functions
        - Modern best practice is to use addEventListener instead
    
    solution_implemented:
      html_changes:
        - Removed onclick="confirmSubmission()" from button
        - Added id="confirm-submit-btn" to button for event listener targeting
        - Cleaner HTML without inline JavaScript
      
      javascript_changes:
        - Added proper event listener: document.getElementById('confirm-submit-btn').addEventListener('click', confirmSubmission)
        - Function now accessible within DOMContentLoaded scope
        - Improved Bootstrap modal instance handling
        - Added debug console.log for troubleshooting
      
      bootstrap_modal_improvement:
        - Enhanced modal instance handling with fallback
        - const modal = bootstrap.Modal.getInstance(modalElement) || new bootstrap.Modal(modalElement)
        - Prevents errors if modal instance doesn't exist
    
    files_modified:
      - templates/accounts/take_test.html (fixed button event handling and modal logic)
      - dev_log.yaml (documented fix)
    
    technical_improvements:
      - Replaced inline onclick with modern event listeners
      - Better separation of concerns (HTML vs JavaScript)
      - More robust Bootstrap modal handling
      - Added debugging capability
    
    verification_steps:
      - Modal submit button now triggers confirmSubmission function
      - Console.log confirms function execution
      - Form submission proceeds correctly
      - Modal closes properly after submission
    
    best_practices_applied:
      - Used addEventListener instead of inline onclick
      - Proper JavaScript scope management
      - Defensive programming for Bootstrap modal instances
      - Debug logging for troubleshooting
    
    conclusion:

    user_request: Fix race condition where last answer not counted in submission (answered 6 questions but showing only 5)
    action: Implemented comprehensive race condition prevention for AJAX answer saves and test submission
    
    root_cause_analysis:
      race_condition_identified:
        - User selects last answer → triggers saveAnswer() AJAX call
        - User immediately clicks "Submit Test" button
        - Submission happens before AJAX save operation completes
        - Last answer not saved to database before submission count
        - Modal shows incorrect answered count (5 instead of 6)
      
      timing_issue:
        - AJAX saveAnswer() is asynchronous operation
        - showSubmissionModal() uses server-side {{ answered_questions_count }} at page load
        - No synchronization between save operations and submission
        - Modal count stale when rapid submission occurs
    
    comprehensive_solution_implemented:
      pending_saves_tracking:
        - Added pendingSaves counter to track active AJAX operations
        - Increment on saveAnswer() start, decrement on completion
        - Prevents submission while saves are in progress
        
      submission_synchronization:
        - Submit button checks for pendingSaves before showing modal
        - waitForPendingSaves() Promise ensures all saves complete
        - User feedback: "Saving your last answer... Please wait."
        
      real_time_count_fetching:
        - showSubmissionModal() now fetches live count via GET request
        - save_answer view enhanced to handle GET requests
        - Returns current answered_count from database
        - Modal displays accurate, real-time answer count
        
      double_safety_confirmation:
        - confirmSubmission() also checks for pending saves
        - Final wait before actual form submission
        - "Finalizing your answers..." feedback during wait

        - Graceful fallback if GET request fails
        - Maintains original behavior as backup
        - Console logging for debugging
        - Proper Promise-based flow control
    
    verification_testing:
      test_scenarios:
        - Rapid answer selection and immediate submission
        - Last question answer followed by quick submit
        - Multiple rapid answer changes before submit
        - Network delay simulation for AJAX operations

    user_request: Fix time display inconsistency in results page (time per question showing incorrect value)
    action: Corrected time calculation logic to show proper average time per question
    
    issue_identified:
      time_calculation_confusion:
        - Total time: 28s (correct - start to submission duration)
        - Time Taken card: 28s (correct - same as total time)
        - Time per question: 7s (incorrect - was showing sum of individual question times)
        - Expected: 28s ÷ 6 questions = ~4.7s average per question
      
      root_cause:
        - question_time_spent was sum of Answer.time_spent_seconds
        - Template displayed this as "Time per question" but it's not an average
        - Misleading metric that didn't represent actual time distribution
    
    solution_implemented:
      calculation_correction:
        - Added avg_time_per_question calculation: total_time_spent ÷ total_questions
        - Provides actual average time spent per question
        - More accurate representation of user's pace through test
        
      template_update:
        - Changed template to use avg_time_per_question_formatted

    user_request: Fix timezone mismatch in submission timestamp (showing 12:04 PM when current time is 5:35 PM)
    action: Corrected timezone conversion for submission timestamp display
    
    issue_identified:
      timezone_mismatch:
        - Submission showing: "July 11, 2025 at 12:04 PM"
        - Actual current time: "July 11, 2025 at 5:35 PM"  
        - Time difference: ~5.5 hours (UTC vs IST offset)
        - Django TIME_ZONE set to 'Asia/Kolkata' but timestamp not localized
      
      root_cause:
        - Using timezone.now().strftime() directly without timezone conversion
        - timezone.now() returns UTC time when USE_TZ = True
        - strftime() formats UTC time instead of local time
        - Need to convert to local timezone before formatting
    
    solution_implemented:
      timezone_conversion_fix:
        - Changed timezone.now().strftime() to timezone.localtime(timezone.now()).strftime()
        - timezone.localtime() converts UTC to Django's TIME_ZONE setting
        - Now properly displays time in Asia/Kolkata timezone
        - Maintains same datetime format: "Month DD, YYYY at HH:MM AM/PM"
      
      verification_logic:
        - UTC time: stores in database correctly
        - Local time: displays to user in their timezone
        - Asia/Kolkata: UTC+5:30 offset properly applied
        - Time difference resolved: 5.5 hour offset now accounted for

    technical_details:
      timezone_handling:
        - Database: Stores UTC timestamps (correct for data integrity)
        - Display: Shows local timezone to users (correct for UX)
        - Django setting: TIME_ZONE = 'Asia/Kolkata' (UTC+5:30)
        - Conversion: timezone.localtime() handles offset automatically

    user_request: Fix race condition where last answer not counted in submission (answered 6 questions but showing only 5)
    action: Implemented comprehensive race condition prevention for AJAX answer saves and test submission
    
    race_condition_analysis:
      problem_identified:
        - User selects last answer → triggers saveAnswer() AJAX call
        - User immediately clicks "Submit Test" button  
        - Submission happens before AJAX save operation completes
        - Last answer not saved to database before submission count
        - Modal shows incorrect answered count (5 instead of 6)
      
      technical_root_cause:
        - AJAX saveAnswer() is asynchronous operation
        - showSubmissionModal() uses server-side {{ answered_questions_count }} at page load
        - No synchronization between save operations and submission
        - Modal count stale when rapid submission occurs
    
    comprehensive_solution:
      pending_saves_tracking:
        - Added pendingSaves counter to track active AJAX operations
        - Increment on saveAnswer() start, decrement on completion
        - Prevents submission while saves are in progress
        
      submission_synchronization:
        - Submit button checks for pendingSaves before showing modal
        - waitForPendingSaves() Promise ensures all saves complete
        - User feedback: "Saving your last answer... Please wait."
        
      real_time_count_fetching:
        - showSubmissionModal() now fetches live count via GET request
        - save_answer view enhanced to handle GET requests
