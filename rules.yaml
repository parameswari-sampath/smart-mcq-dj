django_form_handling_rules:
  double_click_prevention:
    mandatory_implementation:

      - Never use only client-side validation without server-side backup
      - Never trust client-side timer/state without server validation
      - Never implement blocking that prevents legitimate form submission
    
    implementation_pattern:
      - "let isSubmitting = false;"
      - "form.addEventListener('submit', function(e) { ... })"
      - "if (!form.checkValidity()) return; // Browser validation first"
      - "isSubmitting = true; button.disabled = true; // Then disable"
      - "window.addEventListener('pageshow', resetFormState);"

      - JavaScript validation for user experience
      - Immediate feedback for format errors
      - Form state management and visual feedback
    
    server_side:
      - Django form validation (primary validation)
      - Model constraints and business rules
      - Database integrity checks
      - Cross-field validation and complex business logic
    
    principle: "Client-side for UX, server-side for security and integrity"

  user_experience_guidelines:
    success_messages:
      - Keep success messages simple and clear

      - Save detailed information for dedicated detail pages
    
    error_messages:
      - Distinguish between user errors and system errors
      - Provide actionable guidance when possible
      - Use consistent language and tone
      - Handle edge cases gracefully with helpful fallbacks

      - Disable form elements during processing
      - Provide progress indicators for long operations

  debugging_practices:
    temporary_debug_logging:
      - Add comprehensive debug prints during issue investigation
      - Include request data, processing steps, and error details
      - Use descriptive debug messages with context
      - ALWAYS remove debug logging after issue resolution
    
    systematic_debugging:
      - Add debug logging at each major step
      - Log both success and failure paths
      - Include variable states and data transformations
      - Test with debug logging before removing it
    
    production_readiness:
      - Remove all temporary debug prints before deployment
      - Replace with proper logging framework if needed
      - Ensure no sensitive data in debug output
      - Clean code before committing changes
