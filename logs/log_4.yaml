  date: 2025-07-15
  session_focus: Split v1.5 into v1.5.1 and v1.5.2 for easier implementation
  
  user_request:
    - Split v1.5 "Basic Question Shuffling + Simple Security Events" into two separate versions
    - v1.5.1: Focus only on question shuffling functionality
    - v1.5.2: Focus only on simple security events tracking
    - Make implementation easier by separating concerns
  
  version_roadmap_updates:
    v1_5_1_basic_question_shuffling:
      focus: "Essential randomization for academic integrity"
      features:
        - Simple question order randomization per test session
        - Answer choice shuffling per student (A,B,C,D order varies)
        - Seed-based randomization using student ID + session ID for consistency
        - Store shuffle state with student attempt for browser refresh consistency
      implementation:
        - Add question_order field to TestAttempt (randomized sequence)
        - Add answer_choice_order field to Answer (shuffled A,B,C,D)
        - Generate randomized order when test attempt starts
        - Database migration for new fields
      notes:
        - SIMPLE: No complex pooling or algorithms for MVP
        - CONSISTENT: Same order for student across browser refresh
        - ACADEMIC INTEGRITY: Prevents simple answer copying
    
    v1_5_2_simple_security_events:
      focus: "Basic security event tracking foundation"
      features:
        - Basic event tracking: test start, submit, tab switch detection
