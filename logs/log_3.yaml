    user_request: Fix submission freezing on "Saving your last answer" and answer persistence issues (answers cleared on reload)
    action: Debugged and fixed JavaScript timing issues and backend error handling problems
    
    critical_bugs_identified:
      javascript_timing_bug:
        - timeSpentSeconds variable used BEFORE being defined
        - Variable calculated AFTER fetch request but used in request body
        - Caused JavaScript errors and failed save operations
        - Result: answers not saving, submission freezing
      
      infinite_wait_loop:
        - waitForPendingSaves() could wait forever if saves failed
        - No timeout fallback mechanism
        - pendingSaves counter stuck if operations failed
        - Result: permanent "Saving your last answer" state
      
      error_handling_gaps:
        - Backend save operations failing silently
        - No proper debugging information
        - Frontend not handling save failures properly
        - Result: unclear why operations failed
    
    comprehensive_debugging_fixes:
      timing_issue_resolution:
        - Moved timeSpentSeconds calculation BEFORE fetch request
        - Fixed variable scope and timing issues
        - Added proper error handling in save operations
        - Enhanced debugging with console.log statements
        
      timeout_protection:
        - Added 5-second timeout to waitForPendingSaves()
        - Automatic pendingSaves reset if timeout reached
        - Prevents infinite "Saving your last answer" state
        - Improved user feedback and status clearing
        
      backend_debugging:
        - Added comprehensive DEBUG print statements in save_answer view
        - Enhanced error handling with try-catch blocks
        - Better error messages returned to frontend
        - Detailed logging of save operations and failures
        
      user_experience:
        - Auto-hide success messages after 3 seconds

    user_request: Fix time display inconsistency in results page (different time values showing)
    action: Corrected time calculation logic for proper average time per question display
    
    time_display_analysis:
      inconsistencies_found:
        - Total time: 28s (correct - start to submission duration)
        - Time Taken card: 28s (correct - same as total time)
        - Time per question: 7s (incorrect - was sum of individual times)
        - Expected: 28s ÷ 6 questions = ~4.7s average per question
      
      calculation_error:
        - question_time_spent was sum of Answer.time_spent_seconds
        - Template displayed this as "Time per question" but it's not average
        - Misleading metric that didn't represent actual time distribution
    
    correction_implemented:
      proper_average_calculation:
        - Added avg_time_per_question: total_time_spent ÷ total_questions
        - Provides actual average time spent per question
        - More accurate representation of user's pace through test
        
      template_clarity:
        - Changed template to use avg_time_per_question_formatted
        - Updated label to "Avg time per question" for clarity
        - Maintains all existing time display formats
        
      data_preservation:
        - Kept original question_time_spent for future analytics
        - Added new avg_time_per_question without breaking existing data
        - Both values available in session for comprehensive reporting

    date: 2025-01-11
    user_request: Fix timezone mismatch in submission timestamp (showing 12:04 PM when current time is 5:35 PM)
    action: Corrected timezone conversion for proper IST timestamp display
    
    timezone_issue_analysis:
      time_discrepancy:
        - Submission showing: "July 11, 2025 at 12:04 PM"
        - Actual current time: "July 11, 2025 at 5:35 PM"
        - Time difference: ~5.5 hours (UTC vs IST offset)
        - Django TIME_ZONE set to 'Asia/Kolkata' but timestamp not localized
      
      technical_cause:
        - Using timezone.now().strftime() directly without conversion
        - timezone.now() returns UTC time when USE_TZ = True
        - strftime() formats UTC time instead of local time
        - Missing timezone conversion to Asia/Kolkata
    
    timezone_correction:
      proper_localization:
        - Changed timezone.now().strftime() to timezone.localtime(timezone.now()).strftime()
        - timezone.localtime() converts UTC to Django's TIME_ZONE setting
        - Now properly displays time in Asia/Kolkata timezone
        - Maintains same datetime format for consistency
      
      verification_logic:
        - Database: Stores UTC timestamps (correct for data integrity)
        - Display: Shows local timezone to users (correct for UX)
        - Asia/Kolkata: UTC+5:30 offset properly applied
        - Time difference resolved: 5.5 hour offset now accounted for

  session_focus: v1.2.1 Registration Groups Auto-Creation Bug Fix
  
  user_requests:
    - Check for issues in the repository (GitHub issues)
    - Found GitHub issue #1: "DoesNotExist at /accounts/register/"
    - Registration works on user's laptop but fails for others who clone the repo
    - Implement robust registration that auto-creates missing Groups
    - Update version.yaml with v1.2.1 for this bug fix
  
  issue_analysis:
    problem_identified:
      - Registration view expects Django Groups 'Students' and 'Teachers' to exist
      - These Groups are created by setup_groups management command
      - Command not documented or run automatically in setup process
      - Fresh repository clones missing Groups cause DoesNotExist error at accounts/views.py:63
    
    root_cause:
      - Line 63 in accounts/views.py: group = Group.objects.get(name=group_name)
      - Uses .get() instead of .get_or_create()
      - Missing Groups not handled gracefully
      - Setup process incomplete for new developers
  
  actions_taken:
    version_control:
      - Updated version.yaml to add v1.2.1 specification
      - Defined bug fix scope and testing requirements
      - Documented issue description and solution approach
    
    files_analyzed:
      - /Users/dharanigowtham/production/smart-mcq-dj/accounts/views.py (registration logic)
      - /Users/dharanigowtham/production/smart-mcq-dj/accounts/urls.py (URL patterns)
      - /Users/dharanigowtham/production/smart-mcq-dj/accounts/management/commands/setup_groups.py
      - /Users/dharanigowtham/production/smart-mcq-dj/version.yaml
      - /Users/dharanigowtham/production/smart-mcq-dj/rules.yaml
      - /Users/dharanigowtham/production/smart-mcq-dj/CLAUDE.md
  
  solution_approach:
    implementation_plan:
      - Modify registration view to use get_or_create() for Groups
      - Auto-create missing Groups with proper permissions
      - Use constants from smart_mcq.constants for Group names
      - Remove dependency on manual setup_groups command
      - Ensure registration self-heals on fresh clones
  
  implementation_completed:
    code_changes:
      - Added import for UserRoles constants in accounts/views.py
      - Changed Group.objects.get() to Group.objects.get_or_create() 
      - Used UserRoles.GROUP_STUDENTS and UserRoles.GROUP_TEACHERS constants
      - Replaced hardcoded group names with constants for consistency
    
    files_modified:
      - /Users/dharanigowtham/production/smart-mcq-dj/accounts/views.py
        * Line 14: Added "from smart_mcq.constants import UserRoles"
        * Line 63: Changed group_name assignment to use constants
        * Line 64: Changed to get_or_create pattern for auto-creation
  
  testing_process:
    database_simulation:
      - Created backup of existing database (backup_before_groups_test.sql)
      - Dropped and recreated database to simulate fresh clone
      - Ran migrations on clean database
      - No Groups existed initially (simulating fresh clone scenario)
    
    test_execution:
      - Started server using python start.py
      - Accessed registration page at /accounts/register/
      - Successfully registered multiple users without DoesNotExist error
      - Groups auto-created during registration process
      - Registration flow completed successfully
    
    test_results:
      SUCCESS: ✓ Registration works on fresh repository clone
      SUCCESS: ✓ Groups auto-create when they don't exist
      SUCCESS: ✓ No DoesNotExist error occurs
      SUCCESS: ✓ Multiple users can register successfully
      SUCCESS: ✓ Constants used properly for Group names
  
  verification_complete:
    issue_resolved:
      - DoesNotExist error at /accounts/register/ FIXED
      - Registration now self-healing and setup-independent
      - Fresh clones work immediately after migrations
      - No manual setup_groups command required
    
    database_restored:
      - Terminated active connections
      - Restored original database from backup
      - No data loss or conflicts encountered
      - System back to pre-test state
