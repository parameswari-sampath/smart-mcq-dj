      - Questions now filtered by created_by=request.user instead of organization

    problem_identified:
      - Timer showing NaN instead of countdown
      - Issue with template context access to test_attempt.test_session.end_time
      - JavaScript unable to parse nested relationship data properly
    
    solution_implemented:
      - Added explicit test_session and test_end_time to view context
      - Changed template to use direct test_end_time instead of nested access
      - Fixed JavaScript date parsing for countdown timer

      - View context now includes 'test_session': test_attempt.test_session
      - View context now includes 'test_end_time': test_attempt.test_session.end_time

    action: Fixed countdown timer NaN issue in student dashboard by adding explicit time string properties
    problem_identified:
      - Student dashboard countdown timers also showing NaN
      - Issue with template access to calculated properties (session.end_time)
      - JavaScript unable to parse property values correctly
    
    solution_implemented:
      - Added explicit string formatting in dashboard view for start_time and end_time
      - Created session.start_time_str and session.end_time_str properties
      - Updated template to use these explicit string properties instead of property access

      - View now adds session.start_time_str = session.start_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
      - View now adds session.end_time_str = session.end_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')  
      - Template uses {{ session.start_time_str }} and {{ session.end_time_str }}

    user_request: Fix dashboard timer still showing NaN, check git history for working implementation
    action: Fixed dashboard timer by reverting to original working approach from git history
    problem_analysis:
      - Added timezone import inside loop causing UnboundLocalError
      - Custom string formatting approach was overcomplicating the solution
      - Original implementation using Django date filter was working correctly
    
    git_investigation:
      - Checked commit 303d67d where timers were working
      - Found original template used {{ session.end_time|date:'Y-m-d H:i:s' }}
      - Django's date filter handles timezone conversion automatically
    
    solution_implemented:
      - Reverted template to use {{ session.end_time|date:'Y-m-d H:i:s' }}
      - Reverted template to use {{ session.start_time|date:'Y-m-d H:i:s' }}
      - Removed unnecessary timezone import and string formatting from view
      - Kept simple approach that was originally working
    
    files_modified:
      - accounts/views.py (removed timezone import and string formatting)
      - templates/accounts/student_dashboard.html (reverted to original date filter approach)
    
    technical_insight:
      - Django's date template filter automatically handles timezone conversion
      - Custom string formatting was unnecessary and error-prone
      - Original working implementation was simpler and more reliable

    user_request: Dashboard timer still showing NaN, compare working session timer format vs broken dashboard format
    action: Found and fixed the real date format issue by comparing working vs broken implementations
    critical_discovery:
      - Working session detail template uses {{ session.start_time|date:"c" }} (ISO 8601 format)
      - Broken dashboard used {{ session.start_time|date:'Y-m-d H:i:s' }} + ' UTC' (custom format)
      - JavaScript can parse ISO 8601 directly, but not custom format + ' UTC'
    
    format_comparison:
      working_format:
        - Template: {{ session.start_time|date:"c" }}
        - JavaScript: new Date('{{ session.start_time|date:"c" }}')
        - Output: ISO 8601 format (e.g., "2025-01-10T15:30:00+05:30")
      
      broken_format:
        - Template: {{ session.start_time|date:'Y-m-d H:i:s' }}
        - JavaScript: new Date(startTime + ' UTC')
        - Output: Custom format + ' UTC' (e.g., "2025-01-10 15:30:00 UTC")
    
    solution_implemented:
      - Changed template to use |date:"c" for both start_time and end_time
      - Updated JavaScript to use new Date(timeString) directly
      - Removed ' UTC' concatenation that was causing parsing errors
    
    files_modified:
      - templates/accounts/student_dashboard.html (fixed date format and JavaScript parsing)
    
    technical_insight:
      - Django's |date:"c" filter outputs ISO 8601 format
      - JavaScript Date constructor handles ISO 8601 natively
      - Custom format concatenation was unnecessary and error-prone
