  prompt_id: timezone_scheduling_issue_resolution
  session_focus: Critical timezone conversion fix for test session scheduling
  
  user_requests:
    - Fix critical timezone issue where India users scheduling 9:40 AM were getting 3:10 PM UTC
    - Implement industry-standard timezone handling for global deployment
    - Add user timezone detection and proper conversion logic
    - Ensure accurate scheduling for users worldwide
  
  issue_analysis:
    problem_identified:
      - India user (UTC+5:30) scheduling 9:40 AM was storing as 3:10 PM UTC (adding 5:30 hours)
      - Should store as 4:10 AM UTC (subtracting 5:30 hours)
      - Root cause: Server timezone was UTC, treating user input as UTC then adding offset again
      - Double conversion error in timezone.make_aware() function
    
    industry_research:
      - Google Calendar: User timezone detection + UTC storage
      - Zoom: Local input with automatic timezone conversion  
      - Microsoft Teams: Timezone-aware scheduling
      - Canvas LMS: Multi-timezone support for global education
  
  implementation_completed:
    frontend_changes:
      - Added automatic timezone detection using Intl.DateTimeFormat API
      - Added hidden user_timezone field to session forms
      - Added visual timezone feedback for user transparency
      - Enhanced session_form.html with timezone display
    
    backend_changes:
      - Added pytz library to requirements.txt for proper timezone handling
      - Updated test_sessions/views.py with industry-standard conversion logic
      - Implemented 4-step process: Parse → Localize → Convert → Store UTC
      - Added proper error handling for invalid timezones with UTC fallback
      - Enhanced success messages showing both local and UTC times
    
    conversion_logic:
      step_1: "Parse naive datetime from user input"
      step_2: "Get user's timezone from frontend detection"  
      step_3: "Localize to user's timezone (key fix!)"
      step_4: "Convert to UTC for database storage"
  
  real_world_examples:
    india_user:
      input: "9:40 AM (datetime-local)"
      timezone: "Asia/Kolkata (UTC+5:30)"
      process: "9:40 AM naive → 9:40 AM IST → 4:10 AM UTC"
      result: "✅ CORRECT: 9:40 AM IST = 4:10 AM UTC"
    
    usa_user:
      input: "9:40 AM (datetime-local)"
      timezone: "America/New_York (UTC-5:00)"
      process: "9:40 AM naive → 9:40 AM EST → 2:40 PM UTC"
      result: "✅ CORRECT: 9:40 AM EST = 2:40 PM UTC"
  
  files_modified:
    - requirements.txt (added pytz==2024.1)
    - templates/test_sessions/session_form.html (timezone detection and UI)
    - test_sessions/views.py (proper timezone conversion logic)
    - TIMEZONE_FIX_IMPLEMENTATION.md (comprehensive documentation)
  
  testing_guide:
    manual_verification:
      - India test: Schedule 2:00 PM IST → Should store 8:30 AM UTC
      - USA test: Schedule 2:00 PM EST → Should store 7:00 PM UTC  
      - UK test: Schedule 2:00 PM GMT → Should store 2:00 PM UTC
