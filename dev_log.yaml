    action: Changed all queries from organization-based to created_by user-based filtering for security
    files_modified:
      - questions/views.py
      - tests/views.py

    security_fixes:
      - Questions now filtered by created_by=request.user instead of organization
      - Tests now filtered by created_by=request.user instead of organization
