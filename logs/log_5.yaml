  issues_identified:
    csv_import_duplicate_problem:
      - Teacher 1 creates 10 questions, Teacher 2 imports same questions
      - CSV import shows "duplicates found" even though different teachers
      - Root cause: Both teachers assigned to same "Default Organization" 
      - Duplicate detection was organization-wide instead of teacher-specific
    
    manual_creation_missing_duplicates:
      - Manual question creation had no duplicate detection at all
      - Only CSV import was checking for duplicates
      - Inconsistent behavior between two creation methods
